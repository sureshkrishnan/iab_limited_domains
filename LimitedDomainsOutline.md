Background: Why are we working on this problem. Limited domains exist but not well de
Examples: Provide a bunch of examples of limited domains. Both successful and unsuccessful
Security requirements for limited domains:
* Identify boundaries of domain: with examples
* Fail closed principle: Explicit config required for protocol to cross boundaries
Data plane vs Control plane:
(e.g. RFC8212 for BGP)
Encapsulation as a concept: 
* Using encapping as a mechanism for collaborating across multiple limited domains (Yes/No) 
* Talk about security issues (RFC6169)

Attack scenarios:
Attacks from outside the domain
Attacks inside the domain
Inadverdent effects of leaks on the Internet
